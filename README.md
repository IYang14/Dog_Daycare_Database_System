# Dog_Daycare_Database_System
The purpose of the project is to build a database in supporting a local dog daycare center to keep track of the daily operation. The database will store information about the service providers, the customers, their dogs, the services, appointments, as well as records of the transactions customers made. It intends to optimize the operation and deliver better services. 
The service providers information includes name and skill. The customersâ€™ information would include name, address, zipcode and phone number. The dog information will include name, breed and weight. The daycare center provides three major services to customers, which are daycare, boarding and spa services. All the services are by appointment. Transactions will be made in-person at the center after appointments are completed.
